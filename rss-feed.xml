</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <div><img src="https://elomymelo.com/images/samsung-akg-main.jpg" style="width: 100%"><div>The design and build is pretty good in my opinion. The default sound signature is a little too bright for my taste, it can cause irritation when listening to some particularly bright songs that have high-frequency instruments. So, if you are going to use the default sound signature and you also like a bit of powerful bass, then I am not recommending these earphones to you. However, if you are an audio-enthusiast or tech-savvy, then these earphones are gonna be a great choice for you ...</div></div> ]]>

Boom 2 Plus is muddy, less accurate and missing the deep bass. Boombox 3 and Stormbox Blast offer pretty deep bass down to 40 Hz. Boombox 3 has 700 Hz issue and Stormbox Blast has 5.5 KHz dipping issue. The JBL Boombox 3 also limits its bass after 80% volume. Overall, the Tribit Stirmbox Blast is the champion. Boom 2 Plus shines in cool, bold and sexy design ...</div></div> ]]>

To be honest, the beat-synced lights on the passive rads of Boom 2 look super attractive, they’re pretty bright too. The Xtreme 4 offers a premium design and build compared to the Boom 2 speaker. However, JBL Xtreme 4’s 330 USD price tag vs Soundcore Boom 2’s 130 USD makes the Boom 2 a no-brainer ...</div></div> ]]>

The Motion X600 also has bass and treble boost but it’s significantly less powerful. However, it sounds noticeably more open and detailed, good for critical indoor listening.

The single racetrack woofer produces massive power to hang out with the big boys. However, Boom 2’s new configuration cannot produce good stereo imaging.

But the boosted bass helps at higher vol­umes. The power is massive over the old Motion Boom. New Boom 2 is signi­ficantly louder, like 3 LUFS gain in loudness at maximum volume. Also, BassUp increases the bass a lot and makes the sound much louder, even at max volume ...</div></div> ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <div><img src="https://docs.elomymelo.com/docs-images/x4-vs-x3-main.jpg" style="width: 100%;" /><div>Xtreme 4's 68 Wh battery is the biggest upgrade vs smaller 36 Wh on the X3. Xtreme 3 sounds fuller with more upper bass at lower volumes, but the Xtreme 4 starts to sound fuller at higher volumes. At max volume, the X4 is around 1.5 dB louder on average loudness measurement. This is not a big difference but the X4 is a bit better and less screamy for moderate to higher level listening. I think you should not upgrade ...</div></div> ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <div><img src="https://docs.elomymelo.com/docs-images/boom-vs-xs-main.jpg" style="width: 100%;" /><div>My opinion, if you want a speaker for ana­lytical and critical listening, go for the more expen­sive X600. Want a warmer sound with premium build, take the X500. If you want a pound-for-pound champion, Motion Boom is a clear winner. I love the accuracy of the Boom, pretty flat frequency response. There is another option for analytical listening, which is way cheaper than X600 - the Motion+ ...</div></div> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Google Pixel A-series earbuds offer excep­tional balance of build quality, sound, design, reliability, features and price which is extraordinary. This is a great all-rounder under 90 bucks. The sound signature is well balanced and natural with a good amount of details. You don’t get nice balanced tuning with budget earbuds these days ]]>

<![CDATA[ Soundcore Motion Boom Plus is louder than jbl boombox 2 ]]>
</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <div><img src="https://elomymelo.com/images/boom-plus-main.jpg" style="width: 100%;" /><div>Based on Alan's review and my research Motion Boom Plus is extremely loud and very powerful. This speaker is way way louder than JBL xtreme 3 and even slightly louder than the boombox 2 which is insane. TWS pairing and soundcore app is supported which is a huge deal in this budget price range. You can't go wrong here</div></div> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Nillkin Super Frosted Shield Matte case review ]]>
</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[ Nillkin Super Frosted Shield Matte case has simple and minimal look which is very nice and clean that a lot of people prefer over flashy and bulky look. I am a fan of this type of thin and light classic looking case. It's not built for ultimate drop protection but can provide some decent protection from small drops ... ]]>

<![CDATA[ JBL Flip 6 offers meaningful upgrade - close to charge 4 ]]>
</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[ The new JBL Flip 6 having an additional 10 watt tweeter, sounds more fizzy and airy which is way better than Flip 5 but actually close to charge 4 and charge 5. It's quite harsh and bass light at higher volumes. It cannot win over soundcore motion+ in terms of sound quality despite having premium build and design. The price is just okay but not exceptional value for money. Overall the Flip 6 offers great bass at average volume which is kinda special and I recommend flip 6 for ultimate portability, bass response, build and design ... ]]>
